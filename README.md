Coursera Machine Learning Project
Introduction:

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike Fuel Band , and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self-movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset.

About the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset:

The Weight Lifting Exercises dataset WLE dataset, was developed by defining the quality of correct execution which investigates three aspects that pertain to qualitative activity recognition; 1) specifying correct execution, 2) automatic and robust detection of execution mistakes and 3) providing feedback on the quality of the execution to the user. This dataset is licensed under the Creative Commons license CC BY-SA.

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

(Class A) corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied with the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience.

Project rules for submission:

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the exercise was executed.
The "classe" variable is used from the training set
Other variables may be used to predict
A report has been created describing: a) How the model was built b) How cross validation was used and c)The expected out of sample error
The prediction model is used to predict 20 different test cases.
The submission consists of a link to a Github repro with the following files: a) R markdown file, b) HTML file describing the analysis, c) Write-up with < 2000 words, d) Number of figures < 5, e) A repro with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online
The machine learning algorithm has been applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data.
Predictions have been submitted in appropriate format to the programming assignment for automated grading Reproducible Research:
Due to security concerns with the exchange of R code, the code will not be run during the evaluation by classmates.
Classmates will be able to view the compiled HTML version of the analysis if they download the repro.
